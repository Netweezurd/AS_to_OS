# AS_to_OS
The last M$ OS was Win7... maybe Win10 in its early days. Now a days, M$ makes AS, Advertising Systems. But on top of that, the Quantity of telemetry and bloatware have passed every tolerable level. So now we have to make an OS out of this AS. This Unattended file tries to do that.

This autounattend file is based on Memstechtips' repository: "UnattendedWinstall".
I used his IoT-LTSC-Like File to Automatically Debloat Windows 10 & 11. The x86 and arm64 sections have been removed.
So me, NetWeeZurd, hands full of thumbs cannot code worth a dime but I can cut&paste like the best of them.
I added regs and other stuff to kill all the additional garbage M$ is continuously ramming down our throats. 
There is so much stuff here that I lost count. I work in a small business, and we manually reimage computers. 
So no SCCM, no inTune, just a USB key with this file in the root. I should find a better outfit... who am I kidding... 
they let me code... I'm gonna stay here till I croak.
Memory's Tech Tips' UnattendedWinstall generates error files under C:\Windows\Setup\Scripts\
Don't look at mine... "their full of stars!" (－‸ლ)
